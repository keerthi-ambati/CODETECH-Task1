**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :**

**PROJECT : SIMPLE CALCULATOR :**




**DESCRIPTION :**

> The Basic Calculator is a simple console-based Java program that performs basic arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform on those numbers.


**FEATURES :**

> Addition
> Subtraction
> Multiplication
> Division (with a check to prevent division by zero)


**PREREQUISITES :**

> Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
> Basic understanding of running Java programs from the command line

**TECHNOLOGIES USED :**

> Java : The primary programming language used to develop this calculator.
> Java Standard Library : Specifically, the java.util.Scanner class for user input.


**GETTING STARTED :**

> Follow these instructions for running java code on your local machine for development and testing purposes:
> Run the compiled Java program.
**FOLLOW THE ON-SCREEN PROMPTS:**

> Enter the first number.
> Enter the second number.
> Select the operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
> The result of the operation will be displayed.


**EXAMPLE  USAGE:**

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Select the operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Result: 15.0


**ERROR HANDLING :**

> The program checks for division by zero and displays an appropriate error message if the second number is zero during a division operation.
> If an invalid operation choice is entered, the program displays an "Invalid choice!" message.
